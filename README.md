# Data Structures & Algorithms Practice

This repository contains my practice and solutions while studying **_Data Structures and Algorithm Analysis_**.  
The main goal of this repo is to strengthen my understanding of **data structures**, **algorithms**, and their **time and space complexity**, through hands-on implementation and problem solving.

## 📚 About the Repository

- Solutions to exercises and problems from the book **Data Structures and Algorithm Analysis**
- Implementations of core and advanced **data structures**
- Algorithm implementations with a focus on **efficiency and correctness**
- Well-commented code to explain logic and design decisions

This repository also includes additional data structures and algorithms beyond the book to reinforce concepts and explore variations.

## 💻 Language Used

- C++

## 🎯 Purpose

- Improve problem-solving skills
- Build strong foundations in data structures and algorithms
- Prepare for technical interviews and competitive programming
- Share learning progress and solutions with others
